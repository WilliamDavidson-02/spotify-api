This is a small spotify api project that allows you to search for an artist and play there top 4 songs.

The Web api allow a user to make a search for an artist or a track, album ect. The web playback sdk allows the user to play a song directly in the browser.

Local storage saves the recently searched artist making it easier for the user to go back to the previous artists.
